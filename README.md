# Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for an optimized AI opponent. The game uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience.




## Features


- Play against an AI opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm  for intelligent moves.
- Play against an AI opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for intelligent moves.
- The game supports both Minimax and Alpha-Beta modes.
- The board state and game progress are shown in real-time on the GUI.
- Visual indicators for win, loss, or draw outcomes.
- Measure the time that the AI opponent takes using Minimax algorithm or the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.
- You can make a compersion between the Minimax algorithm and Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning based on the time and the performance.






## Technologies Used

- Python 3: The game logic and AI implementation were written in Python programming language.
- Tkinter: Used as the GUI toolkit to create the graphical user interface for the game.
- Minimax Algorithm: Implemented the Minimax algorithm to create an intelligent AI opponent.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Utilized Alpha-Beta pruning technique to optimize the Minimax algorithm for faster decision-making.



## Installation

1- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2- Clone the repository or download the source code files.

3- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4- Install the required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    
## Usage
To start the game, run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

    python main.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Use the mouse to click on the desired cell on the board to make a move.
